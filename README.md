Hello
Welcome to Phil's Kitchen.

This is a website of a local restaurant.

To try out this project,You need to download the zip folder or clone the project into your local machine.

The root directory contains the backend of the project.You want to open the terminal and do an 'npm i' to install the server side dependencies.

Open another terminal and cd into the frontend folder.Here,you also want to run an 'npm i' to install the frontend dependencies.

When that's all done, cd back into the root directory and run 'npm run dev' to run both the frontend and server simultaneously with concurrently.

Now all you need to do is wait and see the magic happen :)
